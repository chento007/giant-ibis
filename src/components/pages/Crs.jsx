        Helping to Keep the Giant Ibis Flying

          Cambodia's national bird the Giant Ibis is making a come-back after
          decades of it believed to be extinct. While the species is still
          categorised as critically-endangered, huge efforts are underway to
          bring it back from the brink of extinction and as an official BirdLife
          International Species Champion of the bird, Giant Ibis Transport is
          playing its part.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2007, the Giant Ibis was designated by royal decree as the Kingdom
          of Wonder’s national bird in a bid to help raise its profile and boost
          conservation efforts. Featuring on the ICUN Red List as
          critically-endangered bird, sightings of the species went unrecorded
          for more than 50 years until it was rediscovered by researchers in
          northern Preah Vihear in the early-1990s.
        </p>

        <p>
          Formerly found inhabiting huge swathes of mainland across Southeast
          Asia, today it is estimated about 200 birds populate the northern and
          eastern plains of Cambodia – predominantly in Preah Vihear.
          Deforestation, climate change and poaching are blamed for the bird’s
          rapid decline.

          Wearing the crown of the largest ibis in the world, the Giant Ibis
          stands at twice the size of the second largest species, hence its
          name. On average, adults grow up to 40.5 inches long, measuring up to
          39 inches in height. The average adult bird also weighs in at 4.2kg,
          with a wing span of up to 22.4 inches.
        </p>

        <p>
          The lowland bird has a striking appearance, with grey-brown plumage
          and naked greyish head and upper neck. The bird also wears dark bands
          across the back of the head and shoulders and has pale silvery-grey
          wing tips with black crossbars. Its legs are orange and eyes dark red.
        </p>

        <p>
          While bird numbers are on the rise, the meticulous conservation work
          carried by various organisations is critical to Giant Ibis' survival.
          Projects include nest protection schemes and educational programmes
          carried out in communities to inform on the importance of protecting
          the bird into the future.

          Tourists are also playing a part in protecting the enigmatic bird. As
          part of our commitment to Cambodia, by travelling with us you are
          boosting bird populations because we plough a percentage of our
          profits into Giant Ibis conservation efforts. Giant Ibis Transport
          also supported the creation of wildlife documentary, Land of the
          Giants, which showcases the majestic beauty of the birds and can be
          viewed on YouTube.

          Several responsible tour operators also offer adventures into the wild
          to see the bird first-hand in its natural habitat. The award-winning
          Sam Veasna Centre is a popular choice and runs an ecotourism project
          at Tmatboey, a remote village in KulenPromtep Wildlife Sanctuary in
          the Northern Plains, as well as a range of other bird- and
          nature-related tours.
